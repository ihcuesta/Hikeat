<b>What is Hikeat?</b>
<br/><br/>
Hikeat is a web application that connect mountain village restaurants with lovers of hiking. The website offers daily plans that start at the restaurant organizer of the plan, which offers breakfast and advice on the hiking trail. Later, the hikers go hiking and return to the restaurant to have lunch.
<br/><br/>
The underlying idea is to encourage ecotourism and offer to local restaurants in mountain towns a tool to get more guests.

<b>Technology</b>
<br/><br/>
Hikeat is a responsive <b>MERN Stack</b> application: backend on <b>Node.js</b> with <b>Express.js</b> framework, database on <b>Mongo DB Atlas</b> and frontend on <b>React</b>.
<br/><br/>
It uses several components of the <b>Material UI</b> library, designed expressly for React and based on the design principles of Material Design. It also uses the package <b>Styled Components</b> to, if we may say so again, style components.
<br/><br/>
Hikeat's maps are built on the <b>Leaflet</b> library, which uses <b>Open Street Maps</b>; in combination with the API REST <b>Here</b>, which allows the conversion of postal addresses to geographic coordinates.
